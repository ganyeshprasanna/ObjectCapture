# Capture a flying object using 6 DOF robot arm through visual Servoing

*Mar 2018 – Present*

Project description
This project is divided in four main sub-tasks:

1.) Using Microsoft Kinect to receive RGBD(red, blue, green, depth) data and process it to get x,y, z coordinates of the flying object(each frame) in World reference through homogeneous transformations

2.) Calibration of the sensor using Extended Kalman filter based trajectory prediction and correction algorithms

3.) Predict the landing point of the flying object in robot arm's workspace

4.) Deploy the PID and other control schemes to perform the inverse kinematics on robot arm so that the robot arm tip reaches the landing point of the flying object
